# Green Screen by Finnvian
Green Screen let's you use 4 light emitting colored blocks to be used as a uniform background. This resource pack uses the 3 Froglights and the Jack o'Lantern and recolors these blocks to (Red: #FF0000), (Green: #00FF00), (Blue: #0000FF) and (Pink: #FF00FF). With this Minecraft resource pack, you can take images or videos of a subject and easily remove the background in a editing software.
